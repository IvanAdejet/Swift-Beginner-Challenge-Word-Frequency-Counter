# Swift-Beginner-Challenge-Word-Frequency-Counter
Goal:
Create a Swift command-line application that reads a sentence from the user and counts the
frequency of each word.

Requirements:
- Ask the user to input a sentence.
- Normalize the sentence by converting it to lowercase.
- Split the sentence into words (you can split by spaces).
- Use a Dictionary to count the frequency of each word.
- Print the frequency of each word in the format: 'word: count'.
  
Additional Challenge (Optional):
- Ignore punctuation.
- Sort the output alphabetically or by frequency.
- Use a Set to identify and print the unique words.

Hints:
- Use components(separatedBy:) to split the string.
- Use a for loop to iterate through the array of words.
- Use a Dictionary to map words to counts.
- Set can help to get unique words.

Expected Outcome:
A functional Swift CLI app that reinforces:
- String manipulation
- Collections (Array, Dictionary, Set)
- Optionals (optional binding if needed)
- Control flow (loops, conditions)
